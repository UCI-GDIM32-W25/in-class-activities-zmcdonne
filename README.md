In class today, I worked on putting in the sprites along with their rigid bodies and colliders, and making sure the simple jump function worked. I also started an outline for the coin code, which I am very much looking forward to finishing. For this commit in particular, I am fixing syntax issues such as lowercase errors and mismatched brackets that were bugging my reused code, where it just checks if the penguin is grounded using tags, so that it only jumps then.

# Week 4


## Activity 0


## Activity 1
When adding multiple locators to the scene, the program cancels out the scripts of all locator objects but one while the game runs. This happens as a sort of safety net, as I understood it, so that in case someone accidentally adds too many, it doesn’t cause bugs and chaos by unactivating the exess.


## Activity 2

## Activity 3
I added pipe sprites and bird. I also got started on the scripts I wanted and made the scene more to my liking.

# Week 5


## Activity 1
I think the designs make sense. If I were building a project, I would probably choose a similar method because I don’t have a better idea for handling data that multiple classes might use, that was until we learned about scriptable objects in class today.


## Activity 2
Model:
EnemyStats,ItemW5Demo2

View: 
DialogueBubble,InventoryUI

Controller:
PlayerW5Demo2, EnemyW5Demo2


## Activity 3


Scenario 1:
Rhythm Game Architecture
We could use ScriptableObjects to represent beats
Each ScriptableObject and prefab could store:
 Timing (when the beat appears),The key to press, The screen position, The sprite or visual representation.
Beats could be implemented using inheritance and polymorphism:
A base abstract Beat class, Derived classes for different beat types (normal beats, hold beats, special beats).
Prefabs could be used for visuals, with ScriptableObjects controlling tunable data like spawn intervals and timing windows.Polymorphism for different beat behaviors.

scenario 2: 
 team shooter
inheritance, state machines. 
Gameplay controllers to handle logic (damage, shields, abilities).
Views for UI and visual feedback. model view with the gamedata for diffrent objects. character and abilites stats model, gomeplay code that was carring out thoose abilites in game  would be controller and view and could be ui for that ability

scenario 3:
farming simulation
state machine for state of growth and state machines for animation, 2d player has animation in state machine and diffrent object atrributes get get their diffrent effects for farming through scriptable objects. 


## Activity 4
Attendance: Isabel Rose Matsuno, Kristian Zhang and me

# week 6

## GDW activity alternative

## Talk: (Senior Narrative Writer), Cory

Notes:
- Voice over direction , ui test , cinematic and mission dialogue , internal , plot and character arc , world building and lore 

- Writing chaos

- Fact any game gets shipped is kinda a miracle 

- Freelance writer 

- Can do multiple jobs 

- In house working on full thing more ownership and influence need to ageee beforehand on multiple projects 

- Creative directors get a lot of influence 

- Preproduction:
- A lot of meetings with stakeholders 

- High level narrative summary 

- Catchy and entertaining only one everyone reads 

- Not done in a vacuum 

- Setting and character done with design art and animation 

- Understand the scope 

- Detailed story line at the end 

- Quests 

- Set pieces 

- Narrative delivery methods 

- How is it gonna be told 

- Consider limitations 

- Text data base tools 

- Letting them work just with their skill making process easier ( let them do tough shit too

- Not in engine so need pipeline to import this 

- Production:

- Write cinematic and mission scripts 
- In collaboration with level design and leadership 

- Working with designer and artists 

- Writing is  the easiest to change 

- Systematic dialogue triggers file names 

- Narrative driven game 

- Like when you do something the npc does it back

- So several type of lines for diffrent interactions 

- Team know the narrative behind what they are working on

- Fits in with creative directors goal

- Casting and recording at the end of the Production does call out

- Air in on recording and motion capture 

- Bio for the ai , writing trailer 

- Non dialogue text revisions 

- Google docs ms office, Excel, Visual scripting , Archweave, Twine , Yarn , Ink inkel for branching dialogue

- Branching narrative important feature 

- Look for work oj another departure 

- Getting email and became assistant producer 

- In house qa team best , try to look for opportunity’s to interact with the department you want like proof reading stuff they don’t want to do

-  I’ve taken this thing form start to finish on portfolio with others  So it’s easy to see

- Keep building a library 

- Networking what is networking even about, igda game meet ups 

- Look for discords you would be interested in ( game design production and qa)

- Disclaimers still in productions 

- Freelance business model look like

- Story Bible over world atlas 

- Stand out by leaning into your strengths , for game writing good to be broad in talent 

- Show you can do a toon of different types of writing 

- Example: cinematic approach to writing 

- More of a cinematic reel for it 

- Finding a voice always ( seems like it is like art like copying ) 

- How to navigate the channel of story Structure being beat by game structure

- Everything is gonna get shorter in a game

- Into the woods video game structure 

- Structure of meetings, depends on teams 

- Concept art every day very informal 

- Small talk going into- that’s really cool and they would talk about it and have a narrative meeting 

- Talking with design less about specific meetings for flow and making sure that the stuff they wrote works from a pacing standpoint and clarity stand point and 

- Most interactions with design is done side by side /

- Hey I did this let’s see their implementation of their writing if not in constant contact something going wrong

- When your work has hit this threash hold I’ll pick up the ball and bring it here 

- Design start off vibe , like we want it to be like this , develop mood and tone broad stroke so for preproduction then turn into cohesive vision 

- Start with whatever is in the driver seat so mostly design what it started with system and narrative design 

- If the game isn’t fun nobody reads the story 

- Not being a shooter is rare but with indie 

- Narrative team proud of not doing that 

- Single player route worked with a comic writer super fun, space combat game and instead of flying small ships it’s big ships , feel like 

- Everyone is gonna have a opinion vs when it’s just not like the game they like

- ( more gameplay focus might help)

- Keep ideas 

- Acting as a teacher as how your specialty should be working

- ( make a time line of games map)

- Can have a goal and execution good let everyone know what the goals is

## Talk: Tech artist, Stephen John (Secret door in Irvine )

Notes: 
- Tech art well developed and 

- Tech art build art pipe line

- Makes the artistic process simpler faster , engineer with artist brain , straight forward 

- Removing tech barriers to implementing art in games 

- Pipeline 

- Put ideas in and video games comes out

- Tech artist worried about each step of that process 

- Simpler faster and possible 

- Art focus on making art and not wrestling with technology 

- Character chart , tools tech art and runtime tech art

- Character is rigging and skinning animation tools

- So they do the rigging so works like a person

- Tools tech art 

- Asset management

- Art import export workflow

- Simplification instead of every devolved needing to know it creates a standard workflow 

- Build tools for work flow

- Runtime tech art 

- Shaders
- 
- Procedural

- Generation

- Optimization

- Shader 

- Procedural genreation

- Optimization

- About making trade offs for certain things like performance budget for rendering characters vs environment 

- Either character tech artists or everything else

- Or run time tas 

- Must work with engineers designers , T shaped mindset 

- Narrow range of skills but understand everything else

- Examples of technical art work 

- So do sunderfolk 

- Scene footprints analyzer

- Presents environments by their memory footprint 

- Breaks down the most expensive asset 

- Memory being drowned by environment so making tools for this 

- Finding most problematic scenes 

- Rebaking scenes to have certain light maps 

- Other example 

- Fox data hookup tool kit 

- Hooked up by designers to artists 

- Connection fx to gameplay 

- Limited to begin with 

- Built out an exstenshin for this character and event 

- Scooped to this entire event spawn this event so no need to touch c# script 

- Set of textures define these and modulate the specularity of the character

- Optimization demo here

- Good communicator as a tech artist

- Learning what these problems are as people are not describing the big problem 

- So really you as describing something else

- Divide and conquer bigger problems into smaller problems 

- Need to approach problems they don’t know the solutions for  Easier way to pick one up is writing shaders 

- Fixking problems 

- Exposes you to context 

- And exposes you to tooling aspect 

- Tool development pure engeeering work100 engineering 

- pro. Reid’s jobs the hardest ahhahaha

- Optimization go Reid about it ahhahaha

- Game art optimization 

- Coan.Stephen 

- Profiler in unity 

- Good to check and record performance information about this frame

- CPU memory and so on

- That nible graph 

- A million tringels rendered on this frame

- So this is the bottle neck others are exsperienfign on their machine 


- Open up a snapshot in render :9,

- Application between render doc records commands so you can lets you go through object by object and look how frame is rendered

- Looks for rendere that are affecting one 

- Someone duplicated scene and wcaled

- Making people’s workflows easier 

- ( make a quiz for specially 

- Get an asset off the unity store and optimize it  Or a functionality in unity you wish worked differently 

- Try to dip into proseduare 

- Learn how to learn

- Guilty guild

- Technical buget

- Gpu 

- Look development heavily involved with 

- Procecleal 

- Had someone else felt with this before and did they document how pick other people’s brains 

- Rune time iq 

- Can we purchase this do they need to be modified 

- Teach look up papers 

- And see what to modefied


## Activity 1
The demo tools I took a look at were the Gizmo, Profiler, and Breakpoint one but had a hard time figuring out usage from script alone. I think i understood them from prelearning slides so my teamates were gonna practice togehter outside of class.

## Activity 2
My whole team was at GDW....
