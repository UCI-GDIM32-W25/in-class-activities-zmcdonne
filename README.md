In class today, I worked on putting in the sprites along with their rigid bodies and colliders, and making sure the simple jump function worked. I also started an outline for the coin code, which I am very much looking forward to finishing. For this commit in particular, I am fixing syntax issues such as lowercase errors and mismatched brackets that were bugging my reused code, where it just checks if the penguin is grounded using tags, so that it only jumps then.

## Activity 0


## Activity 1
When adding multiple locators to the scene, the program cancels out the scripts of all locator objects but one while the game runs. This happens as a sort of safety net, as I understood it, so that in case someone accidentally adds too many, it doesn’t cause bugs and chaos by unactivating the exess.

## Activity 3
I added pipe sprites and bird. I also got started on the scripts I wanted and made the scene more to my liking.

# Week 5


## Activity 1
I think the designs make sense. If I were building a project, I would probably choose a similar method because I don’t have a better idea for handling data that multiple classes might use, that was until we learned about scriptable objects in class today.


## Activity 2
Model: EnemyStats,ItemW5Demo2
View: DialogueBubble,InventoryUI
Controller:PlayerW5Demo2, EnemyW5Demo2


## Activity 3


Scenario 1:
Rhythm Game Architecture
We could use ScriptableObjects to represent beats
Each ScriptableObject and prefab could store:
 Timing (when the beat appears),The key to press, The screen position, The sprite or visual representation.
Beats could be implemented using inheritance and polymorphism:
A base abstract Beat class, Derived classes for different beat types (normal beats, hold beats, special beats).
Prefabs could be used for visuals, with ScriptableObjects controlling tunable data like spawn intervals and timing windows.

Polymorphism for different beat behaviors.

scenario 2: 
 team shooter
inheritance, state machines. 
Gameplay controllers to handle logic (damage, shields, abilities).
Views for UI and visual feedback. model view with the gamedata for diffrent objects. character and abilites stats model, gomeplay code that was carring out thoose abilites in game  would be controller and view and could be ui for that ability and 

scenario 3:
farming simulation
state machine for state of growth and state machines for animation, 2d player has animation in state machine and diffrent object atrributes get get their diffrent effects for farming through scriptable objects. 


## Activity 4
Attendance: Isabel Rose Matsuno, Kristian Zhang and me
