In class today, I worked on putting in the sprites along with their rigid bodies and colliders, and making sure the simple jump function worked. I also started an outline for the coin code, which I am very much looking forward to finishing. For this commit in particular, I am fixing syntax issues such as lowercase errors and mismatched brackets that were bugging my reused code, where it just checks if the penguin is grounded using tags, so that it only jumps then.

# Week 3
## Activity 0-2
Isabel  + Kristin


# Week 4


## Activity 0


## Activity 1
When adding multiple locators to the scene, the program cancels out the scripts of all locator objects but one while the game runs. This happens as a sort of safety net, as I understood it, so that in case someone accidentally adds too many, it doesn’t cause bugs and chaos by unactivating the exess.


## Activity 2

## Activity 3
I added pipe sprites and bird. I also got started on the scripts I wanted and made the scene more to my liking.
